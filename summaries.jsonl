OmniSVG is a unified model for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) generation in the domain of computer vision and graphics synthesis.\n\n2. **\ud83d\udca1 Previous Research and New Ideas:** The paper builds on previous optimization-based and auto-regressive SVG generation methods but introduces a novel approach that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multimodal SVG generation with a new tokenization strategy.\n\n3. **\u2753 Problem:** The paper aims to solve the limitations of existing SVG generation methods that either produce unstructured outputs with high computational costs or are limited to simple monochrome icons.\n\n4. **\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Methods:** The authors parameterize SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, use a pre-trained VLM (Qwen2.5-VL) architecture, and introduce MMSVG-2M, a dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets for training and evaluation.\n\n5. **\ud83d\udcca Results and Evaluation:** OmniSVG outperforms existing
