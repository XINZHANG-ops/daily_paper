# Idea2Story: An Automated Pipeline for Transforming Research Concepts into Complete Scientific Narratives 

This paper is a real use case of **Knowledge Graph** in the field of research agent. The authors facing the good old issue that agents are expensive, slow and hallucination when too many details and contexts. Thus the paper proposed the 2 steps research using research agent. The first step they call off-line, but it is just build the local knowledge graph. They extracted the 3 aspect of metadata of 13k papers and OpenReview. The 3 aspects are **Base Problem**, **Solution Pattern** and **Story**. The nodes are the meta methods and the edges are the composition relations. In fact I think it is very similar to the 5 points I proposed for each day paper., I also included the promblem, solution and the domain and results. And when the agent do searching, the knowledge graph will help to find research ideas, similar papers and similar domain. Specific to their task they also have a Reviewer Agent to give scores on how good the idea is. 

Another angle of this paper is, we all know new ideas are from creativity, but researches are able to make new ideas produced like goods using assemble line, it is all about efficiency. Even if agent might produce a million trash ideas, but since it can do so many so fast, the efficieny using such methods to find new ideas have great potential.
