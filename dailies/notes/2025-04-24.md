Learning Adaptive Parallel Reasoning with Language Models could be a useful referencing paper for any parallel jobs. They designed a method that allow LLMs not just do reasoning thinking in a sequential manner, but has the father and multiple child, but more than just simply parallel jobs, at the end the results will be "joined" and send the message back to the father for next step reasonings. In ACE, SQLs can be done in a similar manner, this is good for SQL validation and SQL voting.
