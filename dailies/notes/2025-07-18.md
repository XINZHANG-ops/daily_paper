The paper π^3: Scalable Permutation-Equivariant Visual Geometry Learning is also a paper whose goal is to reconstruct 3D mdeling from photos or video. However compare to traditional methods, this model like its title suggested, it is Permutation robust. The old methods have to have a reference phone as starting point, and all other frames are build opon that frame to reconst. However this paper's method can take a series of photos, doesn't matter the order, it does not need a referencing point, and it can build the same 3D model which is robust to the sequence. 
I played the demo of this paper which is quite fascinating, as shown below, I simply shoot a a couple seconds video of my laptop and within 10seconds a 3D model is built I can rotate and observe it.
