When I first saw their title I was thinking is this possible. The paper OLMoTrace wants to trace back what was the training data for a specific answer LLM output. But in fact the idea was my using reverse engineering on attentions. But to efficiently search the exact match of the LLM output from the training data. Note that the match has to be exactly match. They efficiently pre-index the training data thus they can do this super fast. Even if not 100% get the reference from LLM's head, but still very cool idea we can potential try ourself. I tried their demo and it works.
