Amazing, the paper that evaluates on GPT4o image generation capabilities already out here. In deed they find it massively output the old methods on benchmarks, what draws my attention are the finding of the GPT4o image gen limitations:
1. inconsistencies in preserving original content during editing, 
2. difficulties in controlling image proportions, 
3. automatic cropping effects, 
4. high-resolution and over-refinement limitations,
5. challenges in handling complex scenes, 
6. occasional color bias, 
7. limitations in generating nonEnglish text
