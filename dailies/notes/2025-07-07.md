The paper Decoupled Planning and Execution: A Hierarchical Reasoning Framework for Deep Search answers a question I have recently, I have been using deep search tool to help me on my weekly write resources collection, I can always see the tool plan the steps and reasoning the output and steps. But traditionally all these work are done by a sigle model, it plans, execute the plan, reasoning and plan and execute the plan until finished. However this has obvious drawbacks, first of all the high level plan and low level plan is mixed together in one chain of thought, secondly its hard to add new tools to the model since we need to either training a new model or involves a ton of prompt tuning work. The paper proposed this Hierarchical Reasoing framework. It has the high level Meta reasoning planner, then it will assign subtasks to those coordinators, whose jobs are deciding which expert or executor is good for which task. Then finnally the executor will run for each sub-task, each executor can be a MCP agent itself. The output will be returned to coordinator, and the highlevel result will be passed back to planner and the process going until done. This framework in my opnion can be used in ACE potentially if we have more tools.
