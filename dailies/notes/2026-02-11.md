# Code2World: A GUI World Model via Renderable Code Generation

This paper is another paper I would love to try. I remember last GUI paper was model be able to purely generate the icon and everything in real time with purely imagination. 

Unlike the previous research approach, ask the model generate the pixels, this paper realized that all GUI are simply code, specifically html code, so why bother generate pixels which is a much harder problem, this is a **Paradigm Shift** in the generative GUI domain. 

I think this paper so far is already very innovative, since Paradigm Shift level change is much bigger than the improvements on the details. Again this somethine I can get my hands on too since they open sourced the code and dataset.
