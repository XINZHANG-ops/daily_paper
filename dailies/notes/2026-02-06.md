# Spider-Sense: Intrinsic Risk Sensing for Efficient Agent Defense with Hierarchical Adaptive Screening

This paper talks about a not common topic I see from the papers, risk sensing. Traditional methods, even in the projects I do in the work, we detect the attacks with layers of filters, like call another LLM or machnisam to detect if the current output or input is harmful, but this is time consuming for those complex agents which need to check the security in every steps. 

This paper proposed as their paper name suggested the **Spider-Sense**, so the security checking is not like those security checking gates like we get on airplane, instead, they build security awareness inside the the agent themself.   So the agnet monitor the user query, the planning, the tool call and the env to feel the insecure all the time, and when it feels not safe it will pause the action. 

The benefits are its faster, since the sense happens while executing the tasks, the accuracy is higher, since its not a simple yes or no but feels the unsafe, lastly it is cover the whole process, no nee to set those safety checking gates.
