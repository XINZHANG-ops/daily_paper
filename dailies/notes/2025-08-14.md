I wish I can read the paper Story2Board: A Training-Free Approach for Expressive Storyboard Generation last year when I did a animation projects with my friends. What we were really cannot solve is the character consistency in creating a series of images. The good thing about method in this paper is it is training-free. It creates 2 methods, one is Latent Panel Anchoring (LPA), it will make each frame has same character as reference in the latent space, second is Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing (RAVM) it will do special attentions between strong attention components like hands, face, cloth etc to make sure consistency of postures and dressing. Also it works on open source models like SD, even tho nowadays there are so many competitors, I feel SD models are not as popular as before anymore.
