Again, another paper about reasoning: Table-R1: Inference-Time Scaling for Table Reasoning. The way they trained the model is still rewards + GRPO which has nothing to talk about. However, this one might be particularly relevant to Ace since paper proposed a model reasoning on tabular data or tables, this is exactly what we need to data interpretation or insights jobs. However we cannot use it directly, the way they trained the model still using single number output as GRPO reward, we should adjust it into our own rewards function, and take the reasoning thought process only for our usage.
