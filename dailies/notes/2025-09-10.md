The paper Parallel-R1: Towards Parallel Thinking via Reinforcement Learning proposed a new thinking schema what they called as parallel thinking RL training method. We all realize that LLM can potentially get the correct answer from multiple trials, thus the paper directly inject this kind of thinking process into the LLM reasoning directly. When asked a question, in the thinking, the model can determine if it needs to try different approaches, and a <Parallel> will be generated, and in this tag, multiple <Path> tags will be generated, each is a different approach. And all paths will be summrized, and return as learnings, so the LLM can keep reasoning based on these parallel thinkings. I think this can be useful for SQL generation, in ACE, each time LLM may write different SQL, I'm thinking this method maybe a way to reduce randomness, if LLM can generate all possible ways in the thinking, it should have a better understanding and output more consistent output? not sure but could have some experiemnt on it.
