The paper ChemDFM-R: An Chemical Reasoner LLM Enhanced with Atomized Chemical Knowledge might not be beneficial to our day to day work or life directly, but I do appreciate people who do this kind of work. The paper tries to bring a great model in the vertical domain of chemistry. This model reminds me of AlphaFold from DeepMind, which predicts protein structures. Whereas this paper focuses on making LLMs understand the structure of chemicals, and be able to reason about the causal relationships of functional groups before and after chemical reactions. To achieve that, the authors built a special domain-specific corpus called ChemFG, which is centered around atomized chemical knowledge, especially functional groups. Based on this, they trained their model through domain pretraining, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning, resulting in an expert model specialized in chemical reasoning. What I find interesting is that, instead of just outputting a chemical product, the model explains why that product forms, by identifying the key reactive sites and tracking how functional groups change throughout the reaction. This makes it more interpretable and trustworthy, especially for human-AI collaboration in scientific research.
