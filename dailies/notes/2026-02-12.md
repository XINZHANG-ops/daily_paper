# PhyCritic: Multimodal Critic Models for Physical AI

When I see this paper is about Physical model and from Nvidia, I want to know this paper right away. 

The paper mentions a very common issue about the AI models in Physical domian. This happen to also be a topic I discussed with my colleagues a couple weeks ago. The model could not handle physical relationships well is not because the network is not smart enough, it could because of the model unlike human they do not have physical body themselves, they never feel the physical world through touching, feeling or sensing, it through reading and pictures, and what they normally call **Embodied AI**. 

So this paper try to solve this problem, the traditional RL has this critic model, and they changed it to **PhyCritic**, not just the naming changing, what they do is firstly use GRPO on a set of physical knowledge. But more importantantly, they do so called **Self-Referential Critic Finetuning**, so unlike old critic only do the critic work, the PhyCritic first itself generate the thinking and prediction itself, then it use its own answer as an reference answer to give rewards to the answer generated by the model. 

The reason why this work is the old critic often tricked by beautiful wording but wrong physicall relation answers, but many times the wording is boring but it satisfy the real world. So given the referenced physical answer, the critic now can give much more better rewarding.
