Technically the paper Voxtral is a technical report for model Voxtral released from mistral. It tries to fillin the gap most open source models are only text based models. Voxtral is able to receive audio and text, it can receive up to 40 mins of audio, and also be able to answer questions of the audio, call tools, function calling etc. It can also understand multiple languages. It uses the transformer architecture, using the Whisper large-v3 audio encoder. The training is also taking the traditional 3 steps, pretrain, sft and human preference alignment(DPO). I'd love to see there are more open source models can handle more complex inputs, which enable us the ability to be more flexible on side projects.
