The title of the paper Agent Lightning: Train ANY AI Agents with Reinforcement Learning really draws my attention. It claims it can train any AI agent, since ACE is also an agent thus I go ahead and read this one. Overall microsoft team propose a new protocal for agent training like what google did to agents protocal like A2A. In short, this framework will not need to change the agent framework or do any modifications, they defined a unified port, while the agent is run, it will collect the action(input), output(chaneg to state) and the reward, and it will be a trajectory of actions and states and rewards, and they also have a standard way to train the RL algorithm with those data. They decoupled the data collection and training with Lightning Client and Lightning Server, client for data collection and send to the server, the server will do the training. What is even more existing is they tested on a text2sql task like ACE, the performance is quite good. This is definitely something I will try when I have time.
