The paper DesignLab: Designing Slides Through Iterative Detection and Correction is one of the most day to day useful paper I have read recently. It make the LLM improve the power points. Before I start reading it I have 4 questions in head, 1. how LLM generate ppt? 2. what training data they use? 3. how to train this?4. how to evaluate this? 
And the answers are, 1. the LLM does not generate ppt directly, they covert ppt into json format like fonts, text, pictures etc. 2. They collect over 20k ppt from online, and randomly change the contents, like fonts, color, positions etc. 3. they use 2 stage training, a Reviewer would recoginize what need to be improved of a ppt, and a Contributor will try to improve the sections, where the sections that need to be improved marked with TENTATIVE. 4. they evaluate with LLM as a judger, they input the original ppt, and 2 improved version, and ask LLM to pick the better one, they also ask human to score the ppts.
This paper is interesting since it really try to solve a complex real life problem rather creating a new training process, I'd love to read more this kind of papers from researches.
