The universal image generation is a pretty cool idea. I do feel the GPT4o image generation really makes a lot of image generation research less interesting, but I still love the effort the author put into this paper. They created the graph structured multi-task dataset. Each image is annotated or 5 meta-tasks (conditional generation, image restoration, image editing, IP preservation, and style transfer). By giving these contexts, the wide range of combination of different tasks can be learnt and done. The way they decompose a complex problem is something we might want to learn from.
