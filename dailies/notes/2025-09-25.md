The paper EmbeddingGemma: Powerful and Lightweight Text Representations introduced a new light weight embedding model based from gemma model. One new innovation is unlike previous embedding models only relies on decoder only model, the new embedding used encoder-decoder and use encoder to initialize to have better context understanding. And it also use Spread-out Regularizer which encourage the embedding spread out the entire space insead of gather around one location in the space. Nothing super exciting but some interesting new embedding model we can test with.
