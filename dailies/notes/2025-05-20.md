AdaptThink: Reasoning Models Can Learn When to Think answers a question of mine for all these reasoning or thinking models, is how we can turn off the thinking.  For gemini 2.5, we can turn parameter thinkingBudget to turn off the thinking process, but not completely turned off. And this paper addressed a better solution in my opinion, model should know when to think and when to not. If we think about it, reasoning is like the system 2, no reasoning is like the system 1 from the book thinking fast and slow, and we, people know when to think and when to answer directly, model should learn that too. The author invented a constrained learning objective to restrict thinking but keep accuracy. And applied a special sampling strategy make the model not collapse into single thinking mode and can pick which mode to use based on the question. I can see for sure this will the trend of reasoning models soon.
