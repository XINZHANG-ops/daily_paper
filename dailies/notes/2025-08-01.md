The paper Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving is a quite fascinating paper that give LLM ability to prove mathematical theorems. Unlike the normal way we give the LLM a theorem and ask it to prove, the traditional LLM would just output the prove directly, which very likely not good answer. And what this paper does is so call "lemma" way of proving, which means instead of proving the theorem directly, the LLM would think like human, it will list a couple of lemmas, and prove the theorem using the lemmas, this is very like the way when we prove math problems, I can still remember when I was in the university, I need to memorize so many lemmas and small theorems in order to prove something new.  And these lemmas and theorems works as building blocks for larger theorems, this way makes great sense for LLM to learn. Thus they train the LLM reasoning, make it tends to write the lemmas instead of write a large chunk of prove directly.
