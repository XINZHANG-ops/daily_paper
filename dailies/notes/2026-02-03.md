# KIMI K2.5: VISUAL AGENTIC INTELLIGENCE

The reason I want to talk about this paper today is mostly about some comments I heard recently. The Anthropic CEO’s comments on the rise of Chinese AI. He claimed that Chinese models only know how to game benchmarks and can’t produce anything truly useful.

This person has always been quite anti-China, and I generally don’t even bother taking such remarks seriously. Since such opnion only make you not learn from a broader perspective. So Kimi  is a chinese model I learnt for a long time, and they release this new version I want to have a look of it.

The paper talks about the strategy of training of vision and text, they mixed in early stage so not make text over vision or the other way, and sft only on text not vision data, and they also found RL on vision helps on text reasoning too. 

But most important work is really about agentic work, they claimed the chain of agent is a dead end, slow, expensive, so they proposed **Agent Swarm**, not simply train many agents in parallel. Agent Swarm is a framework where a trainable orchestrator dynamically decomposes a complex task into multiple heterogeneous sub-tasks and executes them in parallel. The key point here is that parallel is not hard-coded or manually engineered. The model learns when to parallel, how many sub-agents to create, and what kind of agents are needed, through reinforcement learning.

And a final comments aside, as an AI user, I have seen a ton of chinese AI applications which are both useful and innovative, I really not sure why a CEO level who can speak such silly comments, which I leant is you do not need to be cleaver or smart to be a CEO, average or even below can do.
