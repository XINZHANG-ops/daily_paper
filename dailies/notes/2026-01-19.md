# The Poisoned Apple Effect: Strategic Manipulation of Mediated Markets via Technology Expansion of AI Agents

A very unique paper from a super rare angle talks about AI, I think finally economist are finally think about AI LOL. So the paper mentioned about the threatening power of AI, even such AI power is not applied by someone, the existence of it is the factor to change the policy making. A best metaphor would be the nuclear weapon, no country needs to use it, its existence will shape the world. Tha paper mentions a similar property of such potential strong AI, if someone use it, everyone will would be in trouble. 

So if such technology were deployed under certain markets, regulatory objectives such as fairness could significantly deteriorate. Thus policymakers may proactively adjust market designs to avoid worst outcomes.

As a result, advanced AI systems can reshape regulatory decisions and equilibrium outcomes, even if those systems are never used by people in practice.
