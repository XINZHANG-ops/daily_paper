NeuralOS: Towards Simulating Operating Systems via Neural Generative Models is a very interesting idea. Nowadays, many Ai agents are designed to operating on exiting OS. For example agents learnt to click on correct button on the screen etc. But this paper proposed a whole new different strategy, can the model itself be an OS itself? or they call it NeuralOS. They trained the framework using RNN and diffusion model, RNN is to capture a sequence of historical uers behaviors, like mouse moving etc; and the diffusion model is using the RNN output to predict the next frame of the sequence, in other words, we can imagine this is a interactive video for now. Its simulating an operating system inside the neural network itself. They collect huge amount of data from people interaction with Ubuntu system as video data. Now it can very precisely predict next movement of mouse, open or close folder or close tag or windows. But it is less accurate on simulating keyboard inputs and the frame rate is only 1.8fps. But imo, it is a very interesting idea, in the future we can imagine we can install apps, playing games with this simulated OS.

the demo is pretty fun, we can see mouse move is accurate, but keyboard input is basically random
