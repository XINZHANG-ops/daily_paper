The The Bitter Lesson Learned from 2,000+ Multilingual Benchmarks paper reveals a fact that in NLP area, English is way too much over represented, in term of all the benchmarks they collected over last 4 years, i.e the NLP domain focus on English too much, which is not representing the real world application. Also the benchmarks are not perfect, not really align with human preference. They call for more inclusive and better benchmarks in the domain(Which I doubt can be done).
