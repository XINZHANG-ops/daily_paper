As a previous Stable Diffuison player and ComfyUI user, I have to read about the paper ComfyUI-Copilot: An Intelligent Assistant for Automated Workflow Development today. This is a AI assistant built specifically for ComfyUI. It can find nodes, recommand models, install missing packages from a prebuilt workflow, and even create a workflow based on the request. Each works as a subagent, and there is a main agent for the organization. Overall I think the creation of the tool is not so complicated, they basically collect the info about what nodes and models are available, gether the metadata. 
The hardest part is the workflow creation, they collected 9k+ plus open workflows, and using retriever to retrieve the top 3 similar one to the question, plus a reranking. Also since workflows in ComfyUI are basically json data, LLM can generate new workflow referencing the retrieved workflows.
