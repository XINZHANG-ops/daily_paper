The paper Reviving Cultural Heritage: A Novel Approach for Comprehensive Historical Document Restoration brings a topic I feel so exited about, the restoration of damaged old artifacts. What makes it work is a 3 staging process invented by the paper, first step is based on OCR for damage localization, it will find the damaged characters location and how badly it is damaged, second step is a LLM prediction for the damaged character, what makes it good is the paper finetuned the model with traditional documents to make the LLM familiar with old way of writing. Lastly a diffusion model will be used to help restore the exact missing part, and it can restore a page level of damaged document not just one character. I'm very like this paper as it is really making AI for something very meaningful, there are a ton of ancient chinese documents and damaged artifacts, this framework can really help human bring back the damaged history.
