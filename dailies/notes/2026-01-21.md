# Think3D: Thinking with Space for Spatial Reasoning

The paper talks about current vision large models are lacking of ability to reasoning the 3D world, since they are still only looking at things in a 2D perspective. I think this description is quite accurate, since it doesn't matter how mang pictures model reads, they are still just 2D views, to perceive 3D relation you have to be a 3D creature. This really reminds me of the worldlabs project from FeiFei Li, she and her team try to team model the knowledge of physics and 3D perspective. I have heard critize on this project but I do think her thought makes sense to me.

So the paper proposes the model should reasoning the 3D world instead of looking at the pictures, in my words it is **3D chain of thought**, they in fact create 3D worlds with dot cloud and feed that to the model, the model in fact manipulating the view and the view will move with its output, the sequence is like $$observe → manipulate → reflect → observe →$$

from such pratice and training, model learns its action and its impact on the 3D world, its basically let the model play around inside this 3D world, it is not making the model faking it knows 3D anymore, since itself indeed see how it can impact on the image it receives.
