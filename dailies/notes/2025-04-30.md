Another paper I appreciate, not the topic, but the idea. The paper "SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning" aim to get a good reasoning evaluation model, traditionally people get the model by training the evaluator on annotated CoT dataset, but the paper use an "adversarial" way of training 2 models at the same time. The paper doesn't mention, but obviously we can see it has the same idea as GAN model, the generator generate fake images, and the discriminator detect it. The idea is applied here, one LLM performs as “sneaky generator” to generate wrong reasoning steps sneakily, and the evaluator model tries to detect it, whoever wins gets +1 reward, whoever lose gets -1 reward. I like paper that can migrate one technique into another to solve new problems, since most of the time, creativity happens with "cross-boundary" or blender of different ideas.
