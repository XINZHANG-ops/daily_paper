The paper SuperWriter: Reflection-Driven Long-Form Generation with Large Language proposed a quite intuitive workflow for LLM to generate better answer with thinking, this can be adapted to many other tasks. So similar to many current available searching tools with LLM, we have the option to ask LLM do the planning first, and even we can do multiple plans and work on each one. But to save time and money, langgraph can be applied to restore any point of the planned steps. But anyways, the paper proposed a 3 stage planning-writting-refining answering strategy, the SFT is done on for each stage to improve the performance. In our case if we use it in SQL writing, the model can plan N possible SQL possibilities, write N SQLs then refine each SQL.
