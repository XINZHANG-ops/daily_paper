# AORCHESTRA: Automating Sub-Agent Creation for Agentic Orchestration

For this paper they proposed a new agent work flow which sounds quite intereting. The core differences imo compare to traditional **ReAct-like** agents are, it can build sub-agent on the fly, for example tradition work flow has fixed agents like coder writer, but if the task request a music writer, the new framework can create one on the fly. Secondly it can dynamically select the context send to the subagent to reduce cost and noise. Third is it pick the underlying LLM dynamically, for harder task it can use a better model like gemini-3, for simplier task it can use mini models.

How it create agents on the fly is since they define 4 aspect of each sub-agent, Instruction, Context, Tools, Model, and the Orchestrator will simple create a json which dynmically create new instructions, and select proper chat context and a set of tools from tool pools and proper LLM. 

Also the LLM change is something useful in practice, it doesn't sound fancy, but decision when is hard, and use which LLM is not a trivial task for many real projects.
