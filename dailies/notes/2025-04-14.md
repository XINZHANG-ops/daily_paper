The MoE is the standard architecture nowadays for LLMs, they are as accurate, but cheaper and faster to run. And this paper Critical-Layer, Core-Expert, Collaborative Pathway Optimization introduce a method to improve out of distribution questions new to LLM, since these questions the default expert router could be suboptimal. They in fact use the "RAG" idea in the inference time of the LLM, so they retrieve the most relevant expert route, and adjust the default route based on that. This is an amazing thinking, creative and bold.
