All 3 papers today are more or less related to robotics and vision AI. Aside from the paper methods, what I feel recently there is a big trend on robotics area. There are 3 big players now in robots, Optimus from Tesla, Figure AI, and Agility Robotics. Nowadays since the fundamentals of LLM is open sourced and well established, many companies can train their own LLM and get into the game. However robot is fundamentally different, we can see how Tesla is training their robots, each robot is trained by a real human being, and each work's salary is 400 USD per day, and robot learning cost is 200 UDS per day, and the total cost for each robot is 600 USD per day. But this cost is worth it, unlike LLM, the robot training now is not open sourced, all in hands of the players themselves, or I feel like training robots are like training human kids, there is no well-known procedure to follow yet, each companies robot may have their own different personalities, like their own secret sauces.
Currently we have a feeling that AI are replacing jobs in office, but according to this research below(Noyt from above paper), white-collar jobs have lower replacing entry point, but much high ceiling. However, blue-collar jobs once human reach that entry point, the replacement will happen almost immediately to all kinds of jobs. And the current robotics researches are definitely pushing us closer and closer to that point. Imagine all of sudden, drivers, home services, cleaning, consruction workers all becomes robots, no wage required, no rest, no illness.
