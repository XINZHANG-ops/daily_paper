The FlowReasoner paper proposed a new way of doing multi-agent framework. Traditionally, human design a framework for a specific task, but they proposed that each question might need a different multi-agent framework, and the way they do it is by improving the reasoning of LLM using RL with external execution feedback to give the model capability of generating multi-agent framework.
