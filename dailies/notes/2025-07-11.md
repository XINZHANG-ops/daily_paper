The paper MIRIX: Multi-Agent Memory System for LLM-Based Agents proposed a quite complex but reasonable LLM memory system. It tries to solve the LLM does not have long term memory and multi-model memory. It propose:
Core Memory: for user profile, preferences.  
Episodic Memory: for events, timestamps 
Semantic Memory: for conceptional knowledge, like relationships 
Procedural Memory: for fixed procedures 
Resource Memory: for PDF, Pictures, Audio etc 
Knowledge Vault: for sensitive information, like api keys etc
then each section is maintained by an agent, a new question will be classified to some memory types and retrieved memory accordingly.
